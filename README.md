CubeGame
========

A free alternative to the most common voxel games out there on the market!  This is currently in early development, and there are no stable versions of the game yet.  Written in Java under the 1.5/1.6 specification and the LWJGL is used to get access to native code.

Dependencies:
=============

lwjgl 2.9.1 (http://legacy.lwjgl.org/download.php)

Requirements:
=============

Windows XP+, Mac OSX 10.6+, Linux

Intel or AMD dual core CPU reccommended

Accelerated OpenGL display device (OpenGL 2.0+ reccommended but not required)

Java 1.6.0 or higher

Possible support:
=============

Mac OS 10.5.8 (ppc/intel) with Java 1.5.0 support

Currently, in early development, there is support for legacy OpenGL with display lists (OpenGL 1.1).  However, we can not guarentee that our code will support it forever, which is why we strongly reccommend OpenGL 2.0 or better.  Also, not using legacy openGL to render the game will give great graphical enhancements and performance boosts.
